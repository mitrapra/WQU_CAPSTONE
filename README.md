# Capstone Project - Risk & Volatility
Authored by: Pratanu Mitra

**Objective**:
1. The hypothesis we aim to test is that the VIX-based RSI measure, if proven accurate, could significantly pinpoint short-term overreaction and profitability from snapbacks, thereby offering a unique perspective in the field of finance and data science.
2. If the hypothesis is true, generate alpha based on the VIX-based RSI measure
3. Our project stands out with its innovative approach in Comparative Analytics - pitting Machine Learning against Genetic algorithms - with the ultimate goal of maximising alpha and showcasing our cutting-edge techniques.
