# Capstone Project - Risk & Volatility
Authored by: Pratanu Mitra

**Objective**:
1. We aim to test the hypothesis that the VIX-based RSI measure, if proven accurate, could significantly pinpoint short-term overreaction and profitability from snapbacks, thereby offering a unique perspective in finance and data science.
2. If the hypothesis is true, generate alpha based on the VIX-based RSI measure
3. Our project stands out with its innovative approach to Comparative Analytics, pitting Machine Learning against Genetic algorithms. The ultimate goal is to maximise alpha and showcase our cutting-edge techniques.
